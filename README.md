# groupthink-todo-api
This is a group think api built to handle todos, built by the students of web22_mack and web22_sydney! 

## Rules

The rules are simple.
-Everyone contributes something! 
-No one person is driving the production!
-We use try/catch (async) functions in full (so no helper functions!)

## Project Goals

We want to make an API for a TODO react app that we built back in the day. We need to make a list of users that each have their own todo lists. Each todo list has a title and a list of todos. 

We should be able to render a list of users, a list of todo list titles, a list of todos with their titles, and a list of a users todo lists with their titles and todos on them.  

We should also be able to post to each of these items. Delete and update are not required!

Proper error handling should be present throughout.

Most importantly, have fun!

## Preliminary Questions to Group Workshop

 Explain the difference between Relational Databases and SQL.

 Why do tables need a primary key?

 What is the name given to a table column that references the primary key on another table.

 What do we need in order to have a many to many relationship between two tables.
 
 ## Finally...
 
 You WILL have access to all of this at the end of the day! Tomorrow's sprint is open book, you may use this as notes!
